Persist is a tool that checks the Persistent property of concurrent programs under Total-Store-Order (TSO) memory model such as in Intel x86 and prevent non-intended behaviours by inserting a minimal set of fences.

Persistence is a weaker definition than data race, and defined by program order and total store order. Keeping a program persist under TSO guarantees sequential consistent properties of the program.

Another way to avoid non-intended behaviours of programs is keeping it Robust. Robustness is based on program order, store order, and read-from relations that is considered in many previous approaches.

One of important differences between Persistence and Robust that we can verify persistent properties of programs with abstraction that make our tool is more scalable, especially with algorithms of multiple processes that are common in concurrent system.
