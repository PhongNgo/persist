This document explains how to download and build Persist.

Before download and install, you should check requirements of operation system (see 1) and software (see 2).

================

PERSIST is implemented for 32-bit Unix environments such as Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, etc. It can run under Mac OS or other OS, but does not tested stressfully.
