1. effective program verfitification for relaxed memory model: detect bugs
2. counter-example guided fence insertion under TSO: detect and correct
3. Trencher  detect and correct(good)
4: musketeer detect and correct (good)

5: automatic fence insertion

partial coherence abstractions for relaxed memory models: this paper contains result for PSO
